AHP) was developed by Prof. Thomas L. Saaty in early 1970s. It aims to overcome the inherent complexity of decision-making problems by coping with rational and intangible aspects relevant to problems representing all this in the form of non-linear (hierarchical) models that reflect the human perception of specifics of these problems, determining criteria and alternatives in reference to the stated goal as the top factor of the hierarchies (models), and prioritizing successively criteria and alternatives using reciprocal pairwise comparisons. As pointed out by Prof. T.L. Saaty and Prof. L.G. Vargas, the decision maker (a group of individuals involved in the problem's discussion) &quot;... carries out simple pairwise comparison judgments which are used to develop overall priorities for ranking the alternatives - AHP both allows for inconsistency in the judgments and provides a means to improve consistency&quot; (in Models, Methods, Concepts &amp; Applications of the Analytic Hierarchy Process, 2nd ed., Int. Series in Operations Research &amp; Management Science, vol. 175)."/><LineBreak/><Run Text="The given program employs a 'classical' three-level hierarchy, i.e. goal of the decision (level 0) – criteria considered (level 1) – alternatives (options) that must be ranked (level 2), and fundamental 1..9 scale. If needed, it is also possible to switch to a 4-level AHP-model, which has an additional level of sub-criteria (let's refer to it level 1A), which further details the level of criteria that is higher in the hierarchy (level 1)."/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Hope the interface of the program will allow at each step of the actions being performed not to be distracted by insignificant aspects and to fully focus attention on what is being done right now. Have a great time working with the program!"/></TextBlock>
