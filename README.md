# ![](https://i.ibb.co/23B6QsC/icon.png) Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)

This project is an implementation of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) algorithm in C# with a user-friendly interface created using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). It utilizes ScottPlot library for data visualization. The program includes three types of sensitivity analysis: weighted criteria attribute chart, small changes simulation, and one way sensitivity analysis.

## Features

- AHP algorithm implementation
- User-friendly interface
- Three types of sensitivity analysis:
  - Weighted criteria attribute chart
  - Small changes simulation
  - One way sensitivity analysis
- Project saving and loading
- Exporting project to csv

## Installation

To use this program, download the installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/Ivruix/AnalyticHierarchyProcess/releases) page. After downloading the installer, run it and follow the on-screen instructions to install the program on your computer.

## Usage

Once the program is installed, you can launch it and use it to perform AHP analysis and sensitivity analysis.

1. Launch the program.
2. Create new project.
3. Enter the goal, creteria, subcriteria (if needed), and alternatives.
4. Perform all necessary pairwise comparisons.
5. View the results of the AHP algorithm on the project page.
6. Use the sensitivity analysis options to explore different scenarios and analyze the impact of changes on the decision-making process.

You can also find an example project in the [examples](./examples) folder.
